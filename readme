main is row based (more memory eff)

main2 is cartesian based (more cpu eff, theorectically more scalable)



## info

This was a school project to do the standard heat equation in MPI, at the time,
I submitted main2, but it has a 'slight' bug with the ghosting, I haven't changed it
since then as I wanted to keep original. We were allowed to do anything MPI so,
I did cartesian stuff, and even with some heartaches getting it to work, I'd do it again
